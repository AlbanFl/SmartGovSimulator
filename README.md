# SmartGovSimulator
A multi-agent simulator for urban problems.

The framework is sufficiently generic to handle any graph-based multi-agent simulation.

For concrete examples and tutorials, check the [wiki](https://github.com/PaulBreugnot/SmartGovSimulator/wiki).

For the complete java API, check the online [javadoc](https://paulbreugnot.github.io/SmartGovSimulator/).
